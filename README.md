- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @STLmagic
I am an engineer, I create 3D models of furniture and interiors, I write all the diagrams and control programs for CNC machines.
Our capabilities are limited by imagination and CNC machines.
it is important to show potential buyers the symphony of our stl files
control schemes and programs; our practice proves the cost-effectiveness of furniture transition
factories on robotic lines similar to the automotive industry.

We are looking for furniture production partners all over the world.
you will not depend on the quality of work of the hired employee; all the work
 will be performed on CNC machines with the highest precision; with us any project will become a physical reality
